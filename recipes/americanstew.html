        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Beef chuck roast</li>
                <li>Carrots</li>
                <li>Anchovy fillets</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce</li>
                <li>Onions</li>
                <li>Cellery</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Tomato Paste</li>
                <li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
                <li>Potatoes</li>
                <li>Mushrooms</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine stock, tomato paste, anchovies, gelatin, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender and blend on high speed until homogenous. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season beef all over with salt and pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet or large plate and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add mushrooms to Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until liquid is released and mushrooms begin to brown, about 6 minutes, lowering heat as necessary to prevent scorching. Add diced carrots and pearl onions and cook, stirring, until well-browned on all sides. Season to taste with salt and pepper, transfer to a bowl, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Cut seared steaks into 1 1/2- to 2-inch chunks and transfer to a large bowl. Toss with flour. Add beef and any juices accumulated in the tray or plate to the Dutch oven along with bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Stir to combine and return to a simmer over medium heat. Transfer to oven, cover with lid partially open, and cook until beef is starting to become tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Liquid should hold a slow, steady simmer the entire time. Adjust oven temperature if necessary during cooking.</li>
